Build your dashboard here. Suggested views:

- **Dashboard** – roll up review counts, average sentiment, and recent items.
- **Review Detail** – inspect individual reviews, tags, and suggested responses.
- **Simulator** – drive the `/simulate/post` endpoint to test response workflows.

Use your preferred framework (React, Vue, etc.) and point API calls at the FastAPI
backend exposed on port 8000.
